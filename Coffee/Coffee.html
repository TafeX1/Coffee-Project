                <h1>Caramel Macchiato</h1>
                <p>A popular coffee beverage characterized by its distinct layers and sweet finish. The Caramel
                    Macchiato is prepared by combining steamed milk and vanilla-flavored syrup, which is then "marked"
                    by pouring shots of rich espresso through the foam. It is traditionally finished with a signature
                    crosshatch drizzle of buttery caramel sauce. Unlike a standard latte where the espresso is added
                    first, the macchiato method ensures that the consumer sips the bold coffee through the creamy, sweet
                    foam, creating a flavor profile that evolves with every sip.</p>

                <h1>Vanilla cappuccino</h1>
                <p>A smooth and aromatic variation of the classic Italian coffee, the Vanilla Cappuccino is crafted by
                    layering rich espresso with steamed milk and a generous topping of airy milk foam. It is
                    distinguished by the infusion of sweet vanilla syrup, which mellows the intensity of the espresso
                    while enhancing its natural roasted notes. Traditionally, this beverage maintains an equal balance
                    of foam, milk, and coffee, often finished with a light dusting of cinnamon or cocoa powder to
                    complement the fragrant vanilla aroma.</p>

                <h1>Mocha</h1>
                <p>A decadent fusion of rich espresso and chocolate, It is prepared by mixing a shot of
                    espresso with chocolate, followed by smooth steamed milk, creating a balanced blend of bitterness
                    and sweetness. Often considered a bridge between hot chocolate and coffee, it is traditionally
                    served topped with a thick layer of whipped cream or milk foam and a garnish of chocolate shavings
                    or a drizzle of cocoa syrup.</p>

                <h1>cortado</h1>
                <p>A Spanish-inspired coffee classic consisting of equal parts espresso and warm, silky steamed milk.
                    The Cortado is designed to strike a perfect balance, where the milk reduces the acidity of the
                    espresso without masking its robust flavor or body. Unlike a cappuccino, it contains very little to
                    no foam, resulting in a smooth, dense texture. It is traditionally served in a small glass,
                    highlighting the harmonious 1:1 ratio that makes it a favorite for those who appreciate the strength
                    of coffee with a mellow, creamy finish.</p>

                <h1>Pumpkin Spice</h1>
                <p>A seasonal coffee beverage that has become a cultural phenomenon, typically consisting of espresso,
                    steamed milk, and a blend of autumn spice flavors. The Pumpkin Spice Latte is prepared by mixing
                    espresso with a syrup or base infused with cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove, often incorporating actual
                    pumpkin purée. It is traditionally topped with whipped cream and a dusting of pumpkin pie spice.
                    Originally popularized in North America, this drink is synonymous with the fall season and is
                    celebrated for its warm, aromatic profile that balances the bitterness of coffee with creamy, spiced
                    sweetness.</p>
